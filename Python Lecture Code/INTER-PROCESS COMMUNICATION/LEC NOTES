SOCKET
    Command: socket
    Datagram packets transmitted to destination IP host
    A socket is a communication end point
    SOCK STREAM-->AKA TCP :: CONNECTION ORIENTED; RELIABLE DELIVERY
        TCP: SEND MESSAGE AS BYTES STREAM
        Bidirectional
        Meant for network communication but can be used locally
CONCEPT:
    SERVER OPENS PORT; PASSIVE; WAIT FOR REQUEST
        with socketserver.TCPServer((HOST, PORT), MyTCPHandler) as server
        CODE IN TCP_EXAMPLE.PY
    CLIENTS GET EPHEMERAL PORTS; ACTIVE OPENER; COMMUNICATE WITH SERVER
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:

MESSAGE QUEUE
    Linked list of message structures stored inside the kernelâ€™s memory space and accessible by multiple processes
    New messages added at the end of the queue

SHARED MEMORY
    DIRECTLY ACCESSED
    Allow a process to read and/or write to memory created by another process
    Unlike message queues and pipes, which copy data from the
    process into memory within the kernel, shared memory is directly
    accessed
    No automatic synchronization
