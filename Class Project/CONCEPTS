LIMIT ORDER:
    A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock at a specific price or better.
    A buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower,
    and a sell limit order can only be executed at the limit price or higher.
    A limit order is not guaranteed to execute.
    A limit order can only be filled if the stockâ€™s market price reaches the limit price.
    While limit orders do not guarantee execution,
    they help ensure that an investor does not pay more than a pre-determined price for a stock.
MARKET ORDER:
    An order is an instruction to buy or sell on a trading venue such as
    a stock market, bond market, commodity market, financial derivative market or cryptocurrency exchange.
    These instructions can be simple or complicated, and can be sent to either a broker or directly to
    a trading venue via direct market access. There are some standard instructions for such orders.
IOC ORDER:
    An Immediate Or Cancel (IOC) order requires all or part of the order to be executed immediately,
    and any unfilled parts of the order are canceled.
    Partial fills are accepted with this type of order duration,
    unlike a fill-or-kill order, which must be filled immediately in its entirety or be canceled.
